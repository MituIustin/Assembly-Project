This algorithm is written in the AT&T programming language and solves one of the classic algorithmic problems. It reads the edges of a directed graph and can do 2 things:
1) If the requirement is 1, it will display matrix
2) If the requirement is 2, it will calculate the minimum length path from node i to node j
